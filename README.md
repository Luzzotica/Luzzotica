# I'm Sterling Long
I love to build cool things and serve others.  
My goal is to teach and uplift.  
If I can do that, I'm happy.  

# A One Man Army
I focus on Web3.  
I can write your smart contracts. I can build your website.  
I'll break down your project into tiny, bitesize pieces that make it easy for you to understand, and fast to build.  
And if it doesn't exist yet, I can figure it out.  
The best part is, I don't get paid until you get the code.  

# My Interests

- Building engaging, purposeful games.
- Finding cool ways to apply web3 technologies that no one has done before, like a proof of stake chain for Kadena that can still communicate with the proof of work one...
- Creating time to spend with my wifey, my family, and my friends.
